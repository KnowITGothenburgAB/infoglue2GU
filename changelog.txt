Release notes
---------------------------------------
The InfoGlue Team is very pleased to finally announce the first Release Candidate of version 2.0.
This release is by far the largest effort yet and since we incorporated JSR 168 and enhanced workflow support the platform has taken a big leap into the portal and enterprise content management area. As a comment we are also very happy to see that the user community is growing fast even though we have neglected marketing at the moment. 
Quite a few large organisations are now in the last stages of launching InfoGlue-based sites and the release of 2.0 will hopefully get even more companies to consider it.

Thanx to all involved!!

Improvments
- Much better performance and less memory consumption for all applications. Better db-pooling and more advanced caches to reduce load on dbserver.
- Selective cache updates on page cache.
- Added a new WYSIWYG (FCKEditor) which is far superior to the old HTMLArea we used (which is discontinued by the way). FCKEditor is now the default editor.

- Possibility to link to assets and to pages with content as argument from WYSIWYG.
- Possibility to change password easier.

- The user is now directly taken to the master content version when clicking on a content. A new button shows the cover.
- The user is now directly taken to the page component view when clicking a sitenode. A new button shows the cover.
