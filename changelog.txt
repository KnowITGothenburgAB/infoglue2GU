The InfoGlue Team


Abbreviated Changelog from 2.0RC1 
---------------------------------------

New features
- Made it possible to choose URI request parameter delimiter (& normally). To support XHTML better. 
- Added two new interception points: 
	* Publication.Write which notifies interceptors upon a publication taking place and 
	* Repository.ReadForBinding which is a part of the new possibility to allow sharing of info between repositories without having access to the repository in other ways.
- A new feature in content types which lets you initialize attributes with prestated values.
- Made ViewApplicationState.action much more informative and made it possible to empty caches from there.
- Made hotkey Alt+S save in content editing screens - not in WYSIWYG fields though.
- You can now add more tool-language-links in the tool interface from the cms.properties file.
- It's now possible to state that template-choosing dialog should be by default listing components in a different repository than the user are working in. For sharing setups.

Improvements
- An improved cache update strategy which does not require database access during that reqest but rather que it up.
- Improved registry consistency on updates all over.
- Now allows spaces in workflow names
- Much better expire cache strategy with Quartz jobs handling it on all applications.
- Improved NiceURI a lot so it now handles linking between repositories, component editor and some other issues. You can now also choose which attribute/sitenode name it should work with. 
- Cleaned up and fixed so site css does not mess up the component editors gui.
- You can now navigate directly in component editor and still be in decorated mode.
- Changed so the publication details of a publication is now not allways fetched. Only fetched on request and popped up in it's own window.
- We moved email rendering out of the code as proposed by Frank Febbraro so now it's possible to style this in a velocity template. You can also choose html or plain format.

Bug fixes
- Huge bug fixed in asset copy on state change. Made all version of a content work with the same asset.
- Preview button was not included in install
- Settings not done correct in install, affects propertyset.xml and hibernate.conf
- Login filter got wrong parameter which resulted in blank page after login.
1216331 - "Check all" and "Uncheck all" does not work

- InfoGlue 2.0 RC1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes
---------------------------------------
The InfoGlue Team is very pleased to finally announce the first Release Candidate of version 2.0.
This release is by far the largest effort yet and since we incorporated JSR 168 and enhanced workflow support the platform has taken a big leap into the portal and enterprise content management area. As a comment we are also very happy to see that the user community is growing fast even though we have neglected marketing at the moment. 
Quite a few large organisations are now in the last stages of launching InfoGlue-based sites and the release of 2.0 will hopefully get even more companies to consider it.

Thanx to all involved!!
